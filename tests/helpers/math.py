def reduce_linear(x, y, rtol=1e-10):
    """
    Removes unnecessary points from point set w.r.t. to linear interpolation.

    Can be used to test whether two sets of points returned from function
    estimators (e.g. to estimate q-values from scores) and fed into linear
    interpolators are equivalent, i.e. will lead to the same interpolated
    function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array-like
        The x-coordinates of the points.
    y : array-like
        The y-coordinates of the points.
    rtol : float, optional
        The relative tolerance to determine when points can be reduced
        (default is 1e-10).

    Returns
    -------
    x : array-like
        Reduced x-coordinates of the points.
    y : array-like
        Reduced y-coordinates of the points.
